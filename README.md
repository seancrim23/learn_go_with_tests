# learn_go_with_tests

## followed all of the sections from this link
``` 
https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests
```

## sections probably worth going over multiple times (bc they made my brain hurt):
```
reflection
context
maths
templating (didn't really make brain hurt but would be interesting to dive into more)
array slice generics
```
